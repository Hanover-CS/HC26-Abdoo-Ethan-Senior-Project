https://icommunify.com/

This is a website that allows users to create clubs and events for their schools. It is all on one platform so it eliminates the trouble of having to keep track of different sites. Icommunify is limited to certain schools with a plan to expand. I think I want my app to be only within Hanover. There is an RSVP feature which is something I was looking at to add. Users also get a notification sent to them on their calendar. I think these are good features to add since it makes it a lot more seamless to navigate events.

This website is more of what I am looking for although it seems to be used for events that cost money to go to. I was thinking to have my app be for things going on around campus like bingo or other things in the WAC. Springly has a membership feature that is interesting but my app shouldn’t have a membership feature. It should be open to all students. Springly also has a feature that allows you to build a website for your event. I like this idea but it strays from the main idea of my app. Maybe it is something I could add if I have time.

This website is what Hanover uses for their version of what I am looking to create. The issue is that the events posted are more educational events like study sessions and time management tips. I want to have events that aren’t necessarily held by the school. For example if students want to gather in the WAC to watch a movie or something it can be posted on my app. Club meetings will be put on there and other fun things that students are doing together to get people to be more social. Suitable does a good job of organizing their UI. I like the layout. They do a points system to “gamify” the experience but it seems like too much. I want my app to be simple.

https://swoogo.events/

This one just seems like a medium for colleges and universities to use for general information. It requires you to pay. Swoogo does not have that many big name schools that use it. It is only a few private schools so it does not seem popular.
