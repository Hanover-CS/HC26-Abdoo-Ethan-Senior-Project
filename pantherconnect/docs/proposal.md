## Similar Concepts
- iCommunify
    - A **free student club and event platform** built for higher education institutions. Offers group pages, events, messaging, and member tracking. However, it is not open source and lacks flexibility for custom features or university-specific needs. [1]

- Springly
    - This website is more of what I am looking for although it seems to be used for events that cost money to go to. I was thinking to have my app be for things going on **around campus** like bingo or other things in the WAC. Springly has a membership feature that is interesting but my app shouldn’t have a membership feature. It should be open to all students. Springly also has a feature that allows you to build a website for your event. I like this idea but it strays from the main idea of my app. Maybe it is something I could add if I have time. [2]

- Suitable
    - This website is what Hanover uses for their version of what I am looking to create. The issue is that the events posted are more educational events like study sessions and time management tips. I want to have events that aren’t necessarily held by the school. For example if students want to gather in the WAC to watch a movie or something it can be posted on my app. **Club meetings** will be put on there and other fun things that students are doing together to get people to be more social. Suitable does a good job of organizing their UI. I like the layout. They do a points system to “gamify” the experience but it seems like too much. I want my app to be **simple**. [3]

- Rubric
    - This site is more of what I am looking for. Rubric is a tool that helps schools and student unions **manage clubs, events, and funding** all in one place. It lets students **easily find and join organizations**, while also making it simpler for staff to approve events, handle forms, track budgets, and check if clubs meet requirements. By keeping everything organized and digital, it saves time for administrators and makes campus life more active and connected for students. I like what this site does with clubs, but it seems like it is only for school clubs. I think this is the direction I want to go in with the addition of **non-club affairs**.[4]

- Accelevents
    - Accelevents is a platform that helps schools and organizations run events more easily. It takes care of things like registration, ticketing, event schedules, and check-in, while also giving tools for polls, Q&A, and networking. It works for in-person, online, or hybrid events and makes it simple to organize and track everything in one place.I like the idea of this site and I might use it for some **formatting**.[5]

- Modern Campus
    - Modern Campus Involve is a platform that helps colleges boost student involvement by making it easy to run and promote campus activities and student groups. It gives students tools to find organizations and events that match their interests, while letting staff track participation, send reminders, and see analytics to improve engagement and retention. This is the closest thing to what I want my app to be like. [6]

- OrgSync
    - OrgSync is a campus engagement platform that connects students with campus organizations, events, and programs in one online hub. Students can search for and join clubs, RSVP to events, track their involvement, and manage their profiles. Meanwhile, student organization leaders can post events, manage membership, create forms, and communicate with members more easily. This is similar to te club side of my app.[7]
